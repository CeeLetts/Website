     <h1 class="about-header">Chelsea Who? CHELSEA LETTS!</h1>
    <p class="body-content">HI! I see you've stumbled onto the gold mine that is my website, lucky you! Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chelsea Letts and as you may have deduced from the homepage I will someday save the world.  Alright, I admit that is a little bit of a lofty goal but work with me okay?  I am currently a senior at Saint Joseph's University, in the wonderful city of Philadelphia, studying Criminal Justice and Communication Studies.  I hope to one day join the ranks of federal agents protecting and serving America but go a little further with it.  Nothing upsets me more than when people utter the words "FUCK THE POLICE" or anything along those lines.  My goal is to become the Public Relations agent for a federal agency and help banish any negative images and feelings towards law enforcement.  For my senior thesis I decided to explore what factors contribute to negative opinions towards police officers to get a start in accumlinating knowledge and perspective on something I feel passionately about. If you click on the lovely tab above you'll be able to read it for yourself!  36 pages of data, fun of me to include that right? You. Are. Welcome. new friend!</p>
    <p class="body-content">In other news, I come from the small town of Harleysville, Pennslyvania where I attended Souderton Area High School.  I am a Harry Potter enthusiast and challenge you to say you know more about the magical wizarding world than I do! I'm into books, dancing, the holiday season, and long walks on the beach.  That's actually true I really do like taking walks on the beach, not just going for the corny factor here.</p>
    <p class="body-content">So now I set you free to explore my site. There's not much, but it'll knock your socks off!  Here on my site you will find my senior thesis, my resume (so you can please please employ me), and all the different ways to contact and stalk me on social media (since I am POSITIVE you already want to!).  ENJOY!</p>
