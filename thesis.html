      <p class="body-content"><strong>Abstract:</s>The purpose of this research study was to examine the factors that influence the
formation of the public's opinion of the police. Demographic and police citizen contact related factors were both examined throughout the course of this study. This research project was completed by secondary data analysis of the Police-Public Contact Survey, 2002 (ICPSR 4273). Demographic factors were tested by using the following independent variables: citizen race, officer race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and area of residence. Encounter factors were tested through the following independent variables used: contact initiated by police, respondent was given a legitimate reason for the traffic stop, and the respondent's vehicle was searched at the traffic stop. The dependent variables used were proper police behavior and proper police behavior at a traffic stop. All hypotheses regarding encounter details were supported with statistically significant data, while only a few of the demographic hypotheses had statistically significant findings. These demographic hypotheses include race, age, and socioeconomic status.</p>
